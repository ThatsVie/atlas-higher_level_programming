# Python - Classes
This collection consists of Python scripts that introduce and utilize classes for creating squares. Each script is designed to demonstrate various aspects of class implementation, encapsulation, and methods for interacting with square objects.

## Files
**0-square.py**
- A basic class named Square with no additional attributes or methods.

**1-square.py**
- Introduces a private attribute __size to represent the size of the square. Includes proper initialization and attribute documentation.

**2-square.py**
- Enhances the Square class with input validation for the size attribute. Raises TypeError if size is not an integer and ValueError if size is less than 0.

**3-square.py**
- Expands the Square class by adding a method area that calculates and returns the area of the square.

**4-square.py**
- Introduces a property and setter for the size attribute, allowing better control over its manipulation.

**5-square.py**
- Adds a new private attribute __position to the Square class, representing the position of the square. Implements a method my_print to visually represent the square.

**6-square.py**
- Enhances the Square class with proper initialization of the new __position attribute, along with additional features in the my_print method for proper positioning and output.
