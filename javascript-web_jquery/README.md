# Javascript Web Jquery

## Learning Objectives

**Why JQuery makes front-end programming so easy:**

JQuery simplifies front-end programming by providing a concise and intuitive syntax for common tasks like  (Document Object Model) manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests. Its abstraction layer hides browser inconsistencies, allowing developers to write code that works across different browsers with ease, thus reducing development time and effort.

**How to select HTML elements in JavaScript:**

In JavaScript, you can select HTML elements using methods like getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector, and querySelectorAll. These methods allow you to target specific elements in the DOM based on their ID, class, tag name, or CSS selectors.

**How to select HTML elements with JQuery:**

In JQuery, you can select HTML elements using selectors similar to CSS selectors. For example, $('selector') selects elements based on CSS selector syntax. JQuery also provides additional methods for more complex selection criteria and chaining for combining selectors.

**Differences between ID, class, and tag name selectors:**

ID selectors (#) target a specific element based on its unique ID attribute.

Class selectors (.) target elements based on their class attribute, which can be shared among multiple elements.

Tag name selectors target elements based on their HTML tag name.

**How to modify an HTML element style:**

You can modify an HTML element's style using JavaScript by accessing its style property and setting specific CSS properties like element.style.property = value.

**How to get and update an HTML element's content:**

To get an HTML element's content, you can access its innerHTML property. To update the content, you can assign new values to innerHTML or use methods like textContent, innerText, or innerHTML to set the content.

**How to modify the DOM:**

You can modify the DOM using JavaScript by creating, removing, or manipulating elements and their attributes, properties, and content. Methods like createElement, appendChild, removeChild, setAttribute, and removeAttribute are commonly used for DOM manipulation.

**How to make a GET request with JQuery Ajax:**

To make a GET request with JQuery Ajax, you can use the $.ajax() function or shorthand methods like $.get(). You specify the URL to request data from and handle the response using callback functions.

**How to make a POST request with JQuery Ajax:**

To make a POST request with JQuery Ajax, you use the $.ajax() function or shorthand methods like $.post(). You specify the URL to send data to, along with the data to be sent in the request body, and handle the response using callback functions.

**How to listen/bind to DOM events:**

You can listen to DOM events using JavaScript by selecting elements and attaching event listeners to them using methods like addEventListener. Events can include clicks, keypresses, mouse movements, and more.

**How to listen/bind to user events:**

Listening to user events involves capturing interactions initiated by users, such as clicks, mouse movements, keyboard inputs, etc. In JavaScript, you can bind event listeners to elements using methods like addEventListener or JQuery methods like on() to respond to user actions effectively.

## Task Overview




## Usage

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThatsVie/atlas-higher_level_programming.git
```

Navigate to javascript-web_jquery directory

```bash
cd javascript-web_jquery
```

###  Step-by-step instructions for opening and testing your HTML files using VS Code with the Live Server extension:

1. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
2. In the upper-left corner of VS Code, click on "File" in the menu.
3. Select "Open Folder" from the dropdown menu and navigate to the directory where your HTML files are located.(javascript-web_jquery folder.)
4. Once the folder is open in VS Code, locate your HTML file in the file explorer sidebar.
5. Right-click on the HTML file and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. This option is available if you have the Live Server extension installed and activated.
6. VS Code will open your HTML file in a new tab in your default web browser, and the Live Server extension will start a local development server.
7. Your HTML file should now be visible in the web browser at http://localhost:5500/ or a similar URL provided by Live Server.
8. Interact with your HTML files in the browser to test their functionality, such as clicking on elements or observing any changes made by your JavaScript code.

These instructions guide you through opening your HTML files in VS Code, using the Live Server extension to launch a local development server, and viewing your HTML files in a web browser for testing.
