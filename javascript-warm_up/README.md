# Javascript Warm Up
This project is designed to help you become familiar with JavaScript programming concepts through a series of hands-on tasks. By completing these tasks, you'll gain practical experience and understanding of essential JavaScript concepts.

## Learning Objectives

**Why JavaScript programming is amazing:**

JavaScript is amazing because of its versatility, powering dynamic web applications, server-side development, and even mobile applications.

**How to run a JavaScript script:**

To run a JavaScript script, you can use the Node.js runtime environment by executing the script file with the node command in the terminal.

**How to create variables and constants:**

In JavaScript, you can create variables using let or const keywords, with let allowing reassignment and const creating immutable variables.

**Differences between var, const, and let:**

var is function-scoped, let is block-scoped, and const creates variables that cannot be reassigned after initialization.

**Data types available in JavaScript:**

JavaScript supports various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, functions, and symbols.

**How to use if, if...else statements:**

Conditional statements such as if and if...else allow you to execute code conditionally based on boolean expressions. (Boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either true or false.)

**How to use comments:**

Comments in JavaScript can be single-line (//) or multi-line (/* */) and are used to add notes or explanations within the code.

**How to assign values to variables:**

You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=), allowing you to store and manipulate data within your programs.

**How to use while and for loops:** 

Loops like while and for allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met or for a specified number of iterations.

**How to use break and continue statements:**

break is used to exit a loop prematurely, while continue skips the rest of the loop iteration and continues to the next one.

**What is a function and how to use functions:**

Functions in JavaScript are blocks of reusable code that can be called with parameters and may return a value.

**What does a function that does not use any return statement return:**

A function that does not use a return statement implicitly returns undefined.

**Scope of variables:**

Variables in JavaScript have either global or local scope, with local variables defined within functions and block-scoped variables introduced by let and const.

**Arithmetic operators and how to use them:**

JavaScript supports various arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).

**How to manipulate dictionary:** 

In JavaScript, dictionaries are referred to as objects and can be manipulated using dot notation or bracket notation to access or modify their properties.

**How to import a file:**

In Node.js, you can import a file/module using the require function, specifying the path to the file/module you want to import.

## Setup
To get started with the project, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. [Visit the website](https://nodejs.org/en)


Additionally, install semistandard globally using npm:
```bash
sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

**7-multi_c.js:** 
Print "C is fun" a certain number of times.

**8-square.js:** 
Print a square using a loop.

**9-add.js:** 
Print the addition of two integers.

**10-factorial.js:** 
Compute and print the factorial of an integer.

**11-second_biggest.js:** 
Search for the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.

**12-object.js:** 
Update a script to replace a specific value within an object.

**13-add.js:** 
Write a function that returns the addition of two integers, visible from outside.

## Usage
Each task is implemented in a separate JavaScript file within the javascript-warm_up directory. To run a specific task, execute the corresponding script using Node.js. For example:
