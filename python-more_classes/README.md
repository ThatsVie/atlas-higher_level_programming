# Python - More Classes and Objects
This collection contains Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation of classes and objects related to rectangles. Each script represents a different stage in the development of a Rectangle class.

## Files:
**0-rectangle.py**
  - An introductory script that defines an empty class Rectangle representing a rectangle.

**1-rectangle.py**
  - This script enhances the Rectangle class by adding a constructor (__init__ method) to initialize width and height with optional parameters. It also includes getter and setter methods for both width and height, along with validation checks.

**2-rectangle.py**
  - Building on the previous version, this script introduces two additional methods, area and perimeter, to calculate and return the area and perimeter of the rectangle, respectively.

**3-rectangle.py**
  - This version of the script includes a __str__ method that provides a string representation of the rectangle. The representation consists of '#' symbols arranged to depict the rectangle's shape.

**4-rectangle.py**
  - Enhancing the class further, this script adds a __repr__ method to provide a string representation that can be used to recreate the object. It also includes a __del__ method to print a message when an instance of Rectangle is deleted.

**5-rectangle.py**
  - This script introduces a class variable number_of_instances to keep track of the number of Rectangle instances created. It also includes a class attribute print_symbol to customize the symbol used in the string representation of the rectangle.

**6-rectangle.py**
  - Building on the previous version, this script adds a bigger_or_equal static method that compares two rectangles and returns the one with the greater area.

**7-rectangle.py**
  - Enhancing the class with a new public attribute print_symbol, this script allows users to set a custom symbol for the string representation of the rectangle.

**8-rectangle.py**
  - Introducing a class method square that creates a square Rectangle instance with equal width and height.

**9-rectangle.py**
  - The final version of the script combines all the previous features, creating a comprehensive Rectangle class capable of handling various operations and providing flexible customization options.
