# Python - More Classes and Objects
This collection contains a series of Python modules that define a Rectangle class, demonstrating the concept of classes and objects in Python. Each module introduces new features and functionalities to the Rectangle class.

## Modules
**0-rectangle.py**
  - Introduction to the Rectangle class.
  - Represents an empty rectangle.
    
**1-rectangle.py**
  - Enhanced Rectangle class with width and height attributes.
  - Implements initialization with optional width and height parameters.
  - Handles validation for width and height parameters.
    
**2-rectangle.py**
  - Adds methods to calculate area and perimeter of the rectangle.
    
**3-rectangle.py**
  - Implements a string representation of the rectangle using the <strong> __str__ </strong> method.
    
**4-rectangle.py**
  - Introduces the <strong> __repr__ </strong> method for a string representation that can recreate the object.
    
**5-rectangle.py**
  - Implements a method to delete an instance of the Rectangle class.
    
**6-rectangle.py**
  - Adds a class attribute number_of_instances to track the number of instances created.
    
**7-rectangle.py**
  - Introduces a public class attribute print_symbol to customize the string representation.
    
**8-rectangle.py**
  - Implements a static method bigger_or_equal to compare two rectangles based on their area.
    
**9-rectangle.py**
  - Introduces a class method square to create a square Rectangle instance with equal width and height.
    
## Usage
To use and test the functionalities of these modules, you can import the Rectangle class from each module and create instances to explore the various features.
